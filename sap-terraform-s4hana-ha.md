# Automating SAP workload S/4HANA HA deployment on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} VPC with Terraform and Ansible
{: #automate-s4hana-ha-terraform-ansible}

Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} enables predictable and consistent provisioning of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) infrastructure resources so that you can rapidly build complex cloud environments. {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} infrastructure consists of SAP certified hardware that uses Intel&reg; Xeon CPUs and other Intel&reg; technologies. 
{: shortdesc}

You can use Terraform scripts to create a single-tier VPC and create the SAP and Db2 infrastructure on the VPC. The Terraform scripts use the VPC information that you provide and then call the Ansible playbook to create the SAP architecture on the specified VPC.

You have the CLI deployment method from:

* Terraform scripts run from the CLI on your bastion server

It contains:
* Terraform scripts for deploying: one Power Placement group to include all the four VMs involved in this solution
* Terraform scripts for deploying four VSIs in an existing VPC with subnet and security group configurations. The VSIs scope: two for the HANA database cluster instance and two for the SAP application cluster.
* Terraform scripts for deploying and configuring three Application Load Balancers like HANA DB, SAP ASCS/ERS
* Terraform scripts for deploying and configuring one VPC DNS service that is used to map the ALB FQDN to the SAP ASCS/ERS and HANA virtual hostnames
* Terraform scripts for deploying and configuring seven file shares for VPC
* Ansible scripts for OS requirements installation and configuration for SAP applications
* Ansible scripts for cluster components installation
* Ansible scripts for SAP application cluster configuration and SAP HANA cluster configuration
* Ansible scripts for HANA installation
* Ansible scripts for HANA DB backup
* Ansible scripts for HANA system replica configuration
* Ansible scripts for ASCS and ERS instances installation
* Ansible scripts for DB load
* Ansible scripts for primary and additional application servers installation

Ansible is started by Terraform and must be available on the same host.
{: note}

## What is created
{: #automate-s4hana-ha-what-is-created}

The scripts use the information that you provide for an existing VPC (provisioned with SAP Bastion solution) and deploy HA for S/4HANA with HANA DB. You specify the information for the VPC to use in the `input.auto.tfvars file`.

The scripts call the Ansible Playbook to install the SAP architecture.

## Script files
{: #automate-s4hana-ha-script-files}

The configuration and script files are provided on GitHub. Each supported interface for the SAP solution installation has its own folder in the GitHub repository.

## Terraform deployment
{: #automate-s4hana-ha-terraform-deployment}

You use Terraform on the bastion server CLI to download and run the scripts that are located in https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-s4hana-sz-ha. 

To run the Terraform scripts, you modify:
* The `input.auto.tfvars` file to specify the information for your solution: 
    * Enter the floating IP and subnet information from the bastion server.
    * Enter existing VPC information:
        - VPC name
        - Security group
        - Subnet
        - Hostname
        - Profile
        - Image
        - Up to two SSH keys
    * You can change the default SAP system configuration settings to match your solution.
    * You also specify the location where you downloaded the SAP kits.

The {{site.data.keyword.terraform-provider_full_notm}} on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} uses these configuration files to install **SAP HA S/4HANA** on the specified VPC in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.

## Before you begin
{: #automate-s4hana-ha-begin}
 
Before you use the scripts in the bastion CLI or {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}:

* Set up your account to access the VPC. Make sure that your account is [upgraded to a paid account](/docs/account?topic=account-accountfaqs#changeacct).
* If you have not already, create a bastion server to store the SAP kits. For more information, see [Automate SAP bastion server - SAP media storage repository](/docs/sap?topic=sap-sap-bastion-server). You need the floating IP from your bastion server for deployment.
* Download the SAP kits from the SAP Portal to your Deployment Server. Make note of the download locations. Ansible decompresses the files. For more information, see the `README` file, in the respective GitHub repository for {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} and Terraform and on the About page for the Catalog Tile.
* [Create or retrieve an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#create_user_key). The API key is used to authenticate with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform and to determine your permissions for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services.
* [Create or retrieve your SSH key ID](/docs/ssh-keys?topic=ssh-keys-getting-started-tutorial). You need the 40-digit UUID for the SSH key, not the SSH key name.
* (Optional - Catalog Tile) create secrets for your credentials and passwords by using the [Secrets Manager](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-arbitrary-secrets&interface=ui).

## Deploying SAP HA S/4HANA by using Terraform with the bastion server CLI
{: #automate-s4hana-ha-deploy-terraform}

Use these steps to configure the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider plug-in and use Terraform to install **SAP HA S/4HANA** on your existing VPC. The scripts can take 1 - 2 hours to complete.

1. Access the bastion server CLI.
2. Clone the solution repository from `https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-s4hana-sz-ha` and `cd` to the `sap-s4hana-sz-ha/cli/terraform` folder.

    ```terraform
    git clone https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-s4hana-sz-ha.git

    cd sap-s4hana-sz-ha/cli/terraform
    ```

3. Specify your VPC. Modify the `input.auto.tfvars` file to specify the information for the existing VPC, your zone, VPC and component names, profile, and image. You need your 40-digit SSH key ID for this file. The second SSH key is optional. For more options for profile, see [Instance Profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles). For more options for images, see [Images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images). For descriptions of the variables, see the [`README` file](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-s4hana-sz-ha/blob/main/README.md){: external}.

4. Customize your SAP system configuration. In the same file, `input.auto.tfvars`, edit the SAP system configuration variables that are passed to the Ansible automated deployment. For descriptions of the variables, see the [`README` file](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-s4hana-sz-ha/blob/main/README.md){: external}.

    ```terraform
    ## SAP system configuration

    kit_s4hana_export = "/storage/S4HANA/export"
    ```

    Remember, you must manually decompress the `kit_export_dir, kit_db2_dir` and `kit_db2client_dir` files. Ansible decompresses the rest of the SAP kit files. For more information, see the [`README` file](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/sap-s4hana-sz-ha/blob/main/README.md){: external}.
    {: note}

5. Initialize the Terraform CLI.

    ```terraform
    terraform init
    ```

6. Create a Terraform execution plan. The Terraform execution plan summarizes all the actions that are done to create the virtual private cloud instance in your account.

    ```terraform
    terraform plan --out plan1
    ```

    You must enter an SAP main password and your API key.

    The SAP main password must be 10 - 14 characters long and contain at least one digit (0-9). It can contain only the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, @, #, $, _. This password cannot contain `!`. It must not start with a digit or an underscore ( _ ).

7. Verify that the plan shows all of the resources that you want to create and that the names and values are correct. If the plan needs to be adjusted, edit the `input.auto.tfvars` file to correct resources and run `terraform plan` again.
8. Create the virtual private cloud for SAP instance and IAM access policy in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

    ```terraform
    terraform apply "plan1"
    ```

    The virtual private cloud and components are created and you see output similar to the `terraform plan` output.
9. Add the SAP credentials and the virtual server instance IP to the SAP GUI. For more information about the SAP GUI, see [SAP GUI](https://help.sap.com/doc/7abd5470728810148a4b1a83b0e91070/1511%20000/en-US/frameset.htm){: external}.

## Next steps
{: #automate-s4hana-ha-next-steps}

If you need to rename your resources after they are created, modify the `input.auto.tfvars` file to change the names and run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` again. Do not use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Dashboard and user interface to modify your VPC after it is created. The Terraform scripts create a complete solution and selectively modifying resources with the user interface might cause unexpected results.

If you need to remove the **SAP HA S/4HANA** installation, go to your project folder and run `terraform destroy`. The `terraform destroy` command does not remove the VPC in this scenario because the VPC was not created with the Terraform scripts.
